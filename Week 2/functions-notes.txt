So far all the programs we've been writing have been inside main().

A function is a black box with 0+ inputs and 1 ouptut.
func(a, b, c) has three inputs, and one output.

Why do we call it a black box? If we aren't writing the functions ourselves, we don't need to know how it is implemented under the hood.
