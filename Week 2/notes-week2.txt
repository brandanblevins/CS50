arrays = enables you to store a number of integers while only referring to a single variable.
This allows you to avoid the problem with hardcoding several int variables as shown in scores.c.

Example:

int scores[3];

scores[0] = 72;

scores[1] = 73;

scores[2] = 33;


Another, better example:

   int scores[3];

   for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
   {
    scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
   }

This one enables you to get scores without the hardcoding.

An even better example:

   int n = get_int("How many scores? ");

   int scores[n];

   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
   {
    scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
   }



You can convert strings into integers by using arrays.


New header file this week:

#include <string.h>
Adds function 'strlen' in C.



For int main(void), the void means it does not take commain line arguments.

If you change it to int main(int argc, string argv[]) , this now takes command line arguments.



Exit status

To quit a program, you should return a non-zero value from main.
return 1
If all is well, return 0.
