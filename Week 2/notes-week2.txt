arrays = enables you to store a number of integers while only referring to a single variable.
This allows you to avoid the problem with hardcoding several int variables as shown in scores.c.

Example:

int scores[3];

scores[0] = 72;

scores[1] = 73;

scores[2] = 33;


Another, better example:

   int scores[3];

   for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
   {
    scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
   }

This one enables you to get scores without the hardcoding.

An even better example:

   int n = get_int("How many scores? ");

   int scores[n];

   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
   {
    scores[i] = get_int("Score: ");
   }
