printf() is a wonderful tool for debugging, according to the professor.

In the buggy.c file, he used this line: printf("i is %i\n", i);
to do some debugging.
It brought up items like: "i is 0" and "i is 1"

debug50 is a debugger built into VSCode. (It is not exclusive to CS50.)
You must mention the already compiled code to use debug50.
'debug50 ./buggy'

Beyond printf and debugging/debug50, use the rubber duck technique, which is talking through your code out loud to a rubber duck.
Talking through the code inevitably reveals problems.
